# Holiday Hunt - Front-end for Calendarific API

Welcome to the **Holiday Hunt** repository! This is a front-end project that utilizes the Calendarific: Worldwide Holidays API to display holidays worldwide. It also comes with a simple filter feature implemented using the JQuery Builder tool.

## Getting Started

To use this repository and run the front-end locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/NdnHnnt/personalProject-holidayHunt.git
```

### 2. Obtain an API Key

You'll need an API key from Calendarific to fetch holiday data. If you don't have one, sign up at [Calendarific](https://calendarific.com/) and obtain your API key.

### 3. Configure API Key

Once you have your API key, locate the `example.env` file in the project root. Rename this file to `.env`.

Open the `.env` file using a text editor and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Calendarific API key.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Application

After the dependencies are installed, start the application with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the front-end and make it accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the interface to explore worldwide holidays and filter them using the built-in JQuery filter tool.
